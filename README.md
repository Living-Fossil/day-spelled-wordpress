# day-spelled/wordpress
Repository for a WordPress plugin that enables one to insert a date within a WP site with the day and name both fully named.

**Introduction:** It is with pleasure that I am able to announce my new plugin that got approved this past November by WP for addition to their directory at WordPress.org. 

**Summary:** This free plugin enables you to insert a multi-lingual date with the day and month spelled out, anywhere in a site where a shortcode can be used. 

**Plugin Name:** Day Spelled

**Plugin URL:** https://wordpress.org/plugins/day-spelled/

**Description:**  

Normally, the dates generated for you by WordPress give the day and time when a post or was created. Depending on the theme you use, this gets shown either above or below that postâ€™s body.

This easy-to-use plugin enables you on the other hand to insert with a shortcode within your WP site a date which reflects the current date or any other date of your own choosing.

The date that gets to be displayed as a result will have the day and month fully named.  This can be useful if you want to either personalize a communication to your readers or to emphasize a particular deadline.

It is an internationalized function that returns a date with its day and month named in the language determined by the locale that prevails when the shortcode is used, saving you the need to do an explicit translation. 

The plugin is a simple and very tight piece of PHP code which integrates well with the rest of WordPress. 

Please feel free to try this out by taking it for a drive around the block, so to speak. J
